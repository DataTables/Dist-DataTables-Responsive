# Responsive for DataTables 

This is the distribution package for the [Responsive extension](https://datatables.net/extensions/responsive) for [DataTables](https://datatables.net/). Only the core software for this library is contained in this package - to be correctly styled, a styling package for Responsive must also be included. Please see the [npm installation documentation on the DataTables site](https://datatables.net/manual/installation#Node.js-/-NPM) for full details.

In the modern world of responsive web design tables can often cause a particular problem for designers due to their row based layout. Responsive is an extension for DataTables that resolves that problem by optimising the table's layout for different screen sizes through the dynamic insertion and removal of columns from the table.
